# trolling_detector
## Description
The goal of this project is to detect trolling comments under posts of PTT(a famous BBS forum in Taiwan).
Currently, we use text mining techniques such as text segmentation(using [jieba]), tf-idf(feature) to fulfil the goal.
## Future work
We want to utilize some RNN models to improve the performance.
